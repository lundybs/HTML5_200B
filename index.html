    <h1> Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>
        The advent the internet it has been connecting more and more people frequently to things 
        that they like or want to know more about.  With society being focused on the path to be 
        always connected, the demand for a mobile device that can meet all their demands, thus mobile 
        devices are not full personal computer that are in homes with a large viewing area.  Websites 
        in the beginning need computers connected to the internet to display information that the user 
        was looking for, but now with cell phones which are connected to the same network of data 
        can access websites on the go. With their small screen sizes, webpages would not display right 
        or even load correctly as they would at home on a pc.  There were other attempts that web developers 
        tried to fix this problem with mobile websites that would display minimal content on a small screen, 
        but not every company wanted to have two separate websites to maintain.  Then with advances in HTML 
        and CSS we now have responsive web design that allows the developer to make websites for a company 
        and it would display appropriately on pc screens at home and on mobile devices too. Now a website 
        can be maintained and updated in one location, and will not need to maintain content on a mobile site 
        also. Responsive web designs has brought better e-commerce site to a user on the go when they 
        want to purchase an item that they just saw in the public.
